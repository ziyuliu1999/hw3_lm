```{r, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>"
)
```

```{r setup}
library(hw3lm)
library(Rcpp)
```




```{r}
set.seed(1)
x = matrix(rnorm(3*100), nrow = 100, ncol = 3)
y = matrix(rnorm(1*100), nrow = 100, ncol = 1)
res = linear_regression(x, y)
```

We generated data using the `rnorm` function. X is a $100 \times 3$ dimensional matrix. In other words, we are gonna fit the model with three predictors. Y is a $100 \times 1$ dimensional matrix. 

```{r}
lm_res = lm(y ~ x)
```

```{r}
sum_res = summary(lm_res)$coefficients
```

Here is the result generated from `summary(lm(y ~ x))$coefficients`

```{r}
sum_res
```

Here is the result generated from our `linear_regression` code

```{r}
res
```

Here we can see the our result is same as the `summary(lm(y ~ x))$coefficients`, which is what we expected.

```{r}
print(all.equal(res, sum_res))
```

Here we can see that our code in total spend 469 ms and the original R package used 454 ms, which implies that our code is a little bit slower than the R original 

```{r}
print(bench::mark(our_code = linear_regression(x, y), lm_code = summary(lm(y ~ x))$coefficients))
```

We used the built-in data mtcars to test our model. With mpg as the response, disp, hp, drat, wt, and qsec are the predictors. 

We fit our model first.

```{r}
data("mtcars")
x_real = mtcars[, c(3, 4, 5, 6, 7)]
y_real = mtcars[, 1]
res_real = linear_regression(x_real, y_real)
```

Then we use the lm function to fit in the model.

```{r}
lm_real = summary(lm(mpg ~ disp + hp + drat + wt + qsec, data = mtcars))$coefficients
```



```{r}
print(all.equal(lm_real, res_real))
```

Our function's total time is 4ms slower than the built int R-package.

```{r}
print(bench::mark(our_code = linear_regression(x_real, y_real), lm_code = summary(lm(mpg ~ disp + hp + drat + wt + qsec, data = mtcars))$coefficients))
```

Here we will see whether a Rcpp function will enhance the code efficiency.

We firstly create a Rcpp function called `sum_cpp` which used a list of float as the input and a float number as the output. It will calculate the sum of the input list, which we will expect to be same with `sum_func` in the package

```{r}
cppFunction('
float sum_cpp(const std::vector<float> numbers) {
  float sum = 0;
  for (float number : numbers) {
    sum += number;
  }
  return(sum);
}')
```

Here we can see R `sum_func` has the same result with the R original package and RCpp `sum_cpp` function.

```{r}
all.equal(sum_func(1:10), sum(1:10))
all.equal(sum_func(1:10), sum_cpp(1:10))
```

R function `sum_func` has a more efficient performance than the Rcpp `sum_cpp` function

```{r}
print(bench::mark(rsum = sum_func(1:10), csum = sum_cpp(1:10)))
```

R function `sum_func` has a less efficient performance than original R package `sum`

```{r}
print(bench::mark(rsum = sum_func(1:10), osum = sum(1:10)))
```
