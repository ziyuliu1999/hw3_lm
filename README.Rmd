## Overview

hw3_lm is a R package created for the biostat625 homework 3. hw3_lm contain two function which are `linear_regression(X, Y)` and `sum_func(numbs)`

`linear_regression(X, Y)` is a function that fit in a linear model with matrix/dataframe Y as the response and matrix/dataframe X as the predictor. The return is expected to get the same result with the `summary(lm(Y ~ X))$coefficients`. The return value is a table with four columns. The first column is the coefficients estimate,  corresponding standard error,t values and p values.

`sum_func(numbs)` is a function that will calculate the sum of the number element in the list. The return is expected to get the same result with `sum(numbs)`. The return will be a number.


## Installation

You can install the development version of hw3lm from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("ziyuliu1999/hw3_lm")
```

## Example 

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem using `linear_regression` function in the package:

```{r example}
library(hw3lm)
set.seed(1)
x = matrix(rnorm(3*100), nrow = 100, ncol = 3)
y = matrix(rnorm(1*100), nrow = 100, ncol = 1)
res = linear_regression(x, y)
```

We use `rnorm` to generate a $100 \times 3$ dimensional matrix as the predictors of the fitting model and generate a $100 \times 1$ dimensional matrix as the response of the fitting model. To make the code reproducible, let's set the seed to 1.

Here is the return of te `linear_regression` model. The first column is the coefficients estimate, the second column is the standard error of the corresponding coefficients, the third column is the t value of the corresponding coefficients, and the fourth column is the P-value of the coefficients. A same perfomance can be achieved via using the `summary(lm(y ~ x))$coefficients`. It is mainly used to compare the code efficiency with the Rcpp.

```{r}
res
```

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem using `sum_func` function in the package:

```{r}
sum_func(1:10)
```
